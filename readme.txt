ISAD157 - Facebook Massaging Application

A sample messaging application demonstrating the convertion of UML diagram to actual
code implementation. This sample project also comes with a sample interface that allows
you to see what the messaging app would roughly look like if it was to be a fully-fledged
application.

These examples including:

- Searching for a user
- Adding a Friend
- Sending a Message
- Viewing conversations
- Viewing selected conversations messages

Most of these were constructed from the sequence and class diagrams in order to show how
the diagrams work in actual code. You will also see the main handler classes which are the
control classes between boundaries and the entities of this application. While the diagrams
show more of these classes, there is only UserHandler and MessageHandler in this sample code.
